<h1>H6</h1>

<p>For this final chapter my assignment is:<br>
making a game of Memory<br>
Yes that's literally it.</p>
<p>The game has 9 different images and every different image has an identical copy of itself.<br>
If you click both the original and the copy within 2 clicks then you get a point.<br>
The game is over when all images have been flipped over.</p>
<p>This game is a Player vs Player game almost like the Wario game i made in Java<br>
Except instead of the AI being your opponent it's either another person<br>
(Or yourself i guess if you want to test it out)</p>

<p>Go on play some <a href="../H6/Memory.html">Memory</a></p>
