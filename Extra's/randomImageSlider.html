<p>this imageslider works slightly different from H4's<br>
what this one does is it takes the same 9 images but randomizes which appears<br>
this means they can appear multiple times in a row which means nothing happens on screen<br>
but something will happen in the console<br>
Also the first image will ALWAYS be number 9</p>
