<h1>Javascript</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to another website i made for assignments.<br>
    There is 1: not to many assignments this time around<br>
    and 2: i will be using Javascript for all assignments.<br>
    As usual click (tap if on mobile) the button to see each assignment.</p>
    <p>Please ignore the fact that i made a similar website<br>
    it's just more convenient to use Phpstorm for this than Visual Studio Code</p>
    <p>another edit: i did figure out that Visual Studio Code can also be used for this<br>
    but since i've almost finished Javascript entirely on PHPStorm.<br>
    it would be wise to finish it with PHPStorm.</p>
<p>Update 6-1-2021: added an Extra's page in the navbar above for little side projects</p>
